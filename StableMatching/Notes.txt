In this approach, adding a user to a lobby essentially marries the lobby to the users and is aware of events
that occur with the user by registering it's methods to the user, which is called upon modification of a user.
Although ideally, the lobby should only react to a modification to one of it's users, it sometimes is required
to modify the user's attributes as well.
